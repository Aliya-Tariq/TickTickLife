🚨 WAKE UP CALL: What if I told you that you're unconsciously giving away **3–5 years of your precious life** to mindless scrolling, binge-watching, and other time-wasting habits? 

<br>

<br>

**TickTick Life** is part productivity tool, part psychology experiment, and part wake-up call. It calculates your estimated remaining lifespan—then shows you how much of it you’ll lose to daily habits like scrolling, sleeping, working, and... existing.

## 🧠 The Brutal Truth About Your Time

> *"The trouble is, you think you have time."* - Buddha

Every second you're reading this, your life clock is ticking. But here's the shocking reality:

- 📱 **Average person spends 7+ hours daily on screens** → That's 2.5 years of your remaining life
- 😴 **We sleep 1/3 of our lives** → 25+ years unconscious
- 🚗 **Commuting steals 1+ years** → Time you'll never get back
- 🍿 **Binge-watching consumes 2+ years** → Entertainment that entertains you to death

**The math is terrifying. Out of your remaining years, how many will you actually LIVE consciously?**
